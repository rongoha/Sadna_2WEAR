# 2WEAR Project
We, four young programmers - Bar Reuven, Gal Baron, Ron Gover, and Stav Cohen - collaborated to develop the 2WEAR project. Our aim was to create a platform for buying, selling, and exchanging second-hand clothing, with the primary goal of promoting clothing recycling and protecting the environment.

# Technologies Used

# Additional Integrations
