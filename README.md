# 2WEAR Project

We, four young programmers - Bar Reuven, Gal Baron, Ron Gover, and Stav Cohen - collaborated to develop this project with the aim of creating a platform for buying, selling, and exchanging second-hand clothing. Our primary goal was to promote clothing recycling and protect the environment. To achieve this, we utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Bootstrap.

Additionally, we connected the platform to a cPanel server for data storage and management. We also integrated the platform with OpenStreetMap and PayPal APIs for added functionality.
